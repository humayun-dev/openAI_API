            "\n",
            "1. **Readability:** If you have only a few cases (3 in your case), both nested if-else and switch statements are easy to read and understand. However, switch statements are generally considered more readable and expressive when dealing with multiple cases.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Performance:** In some cases, using a switch statement might be more efficient than using nested if-else statements, especially when dealing with a larger number of cases. This can depend on the language and compiler optimizations.\n",

            "Based on the above considerations, in your scenario of handling 3 cases, you can use either a switch statement or nested if-else statements. If the cases are straightforward and simple, you might consider using a switch statement for better readability. However, if the cases involve complex conditions, using nested if-else statements might be a better choice.\n",

            "Provide the code why switch is faster than if-else\n",
            "Little Optimus: In general, the `switch` statement can be faster than a series of `if-else` statements because it is implemented in a way that allows for efficient jump table lookup. \n",
            "\n",
            "When you use `switch`, the compiler can optimize the code by creating a jump table where the program can directly jump to the appropriate case without having to evaluate each condition sequentially. This can lead to faster execution compared to evaluating each condition in an `if-else` ladder.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the actual performance difference between `switch` and `if-else` may vary depending on the specific scenario and the compiler optimization. In some cases, the performance difference may be negligible.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's worth noting that the primary reason to choose `switch` over `if-else` should be based on readability and maintainability of the code, rather than just performance. Choose the appropriate control structure based on the specific requirements of your code rather than focusing solely on speed optimization.\n",

            "Provide the code when to use the nested loops? what are the conditions?\n",
            "Little Optimus: Nested loops are used when you want to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, and within each iteration of the outer loop, you need to execute another set of instructions multiple times controlled by an inner loop. \n",
            "\n",
            "Conditions when you might need nested loops:\n",
            "1. **Processing a 2D array**: When you are working with a 2D array or matrix, you might need nested loops to iterate over each element.\n",
            "2. **Generating combinations or permutations**: If you need to generate combinations or permutations of a set of elements, nested loops can be used.\n",
            "3. **Tree traversal**: When dealing with hierarchical data structures like trees, nested loops can be useful for traversal.\n",
            "4. **Matrix multiplication**: When performing matrix multiplication, you typically use nested loops for iterating over the elements of the matrices.\n",
            "5. **Pattern printing**: If you need to print patterns or shapes composed of characters, nested loops can help in controlling the rows and columns.\n",
